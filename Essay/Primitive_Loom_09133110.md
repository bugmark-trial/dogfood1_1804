Weaving, the oldest of the industrial arts, dates back so far that no one can
say when or where it had its beginning. Spinning and weaving have been
practised by humans for thousands of years and carried by them to great
proficiency. The Israelites were probably familiar with the art of weaving
before their sojourn in Egypt, but it was there that they attained the skill
which enabled them to execute the hangings in the Tabernacle. From the Middle
East the art of weaving passed through Europe and became known in England
after the Roman conquest. No doubt primitive weaving with vegetable fibres, and
perhaps with wool, was known in a very crude way before that time. How the art
developed, and how improvement followed improvement, makes very interesting
reading for the student of textile science. The Egyptians are supposed to have
been inventors of the loom. There were two kinds in use, one horizontal
and the other perpendicular. Instead of a shuttle they used a stick with a hook
at one end, which was used also as a batten. Herodotus says that it was the
practice of the Egyptians to push the woof downwards, and this method is
pictured in many paintings.
