The "tragedy of the commons" is a story invented by
modern capitalists to explain free riding behavior
seen in some social situations, but not in real-life
traditional commons.

In the "tragedy of the commons" story, a group of
people with access to a common grazing area all add
additional animals, resulting in depletion of the
grass, erosion, and failure of the common resource.

In actual pre-Enclosure commons in the British Isles,
tradition placed a complex web of restrictions on
who could do what. Hunting, logging, and grazing were
all subject to traditional practices that restricted
the rate at which resources could be extracted from
the commons.  Other kinds of commons also had different
practices to prevent a "tragedy."

Tragedy of the commons is one possible explanation
for modern overfishing, but some market advocates blame
the problem on fuel subsidies.

Open source development has market failures but no
tragedy of the commons in the usual sense, because
the common resource cannot be depleted by additional
users.  Other kinds of free riding behavior are
present, however, and need to be addressed by better
market design.
