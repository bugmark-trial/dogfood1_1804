XXV. The Pythagoreans were wont betimes in <b>the</b>
morning the first thing they did, to look up unto the
heavens, <b>to</b> put themselves in mind of <b>them</b> who
constantly and invariably did perform their task: as also to
put themselves in mind of orderliness, or good order, and of
purity, and of naked simplicity. For no star or planet hath
any cover before it.
