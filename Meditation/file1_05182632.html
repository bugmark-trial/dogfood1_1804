XXII. Herein doth consist happiness of life, for a man to
know thoroughly the true nature of everything; <b>what</b>
is the matter, and what is the form of it: with all his
heart and soul, ever to do that which is just, and to speak
the truth. What then remaineth but to enjoy <b>thy</b> life
in a course and coherence of good actions, one upon another
immediately succeeding, and <b>never</b> interrupted, though
for never so little a while?
