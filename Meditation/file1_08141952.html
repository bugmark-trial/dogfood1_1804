Truly a rare opportunity was given to Marcus Aurelius of
showing what the mind can <b>do</b> in despite of
circumstances. Most peaceful of warriors, a magnificent
monarch whose ideal was quiet happiness in home life, bent
to obscurity yet born to greatness, the loving father of
children who died young or turned out hateful, his life was
<b>one</b> paradox. That nothing might lack, it was in camp
before the face of the <b>enemy</b> that he passed away and
went to his own place.
