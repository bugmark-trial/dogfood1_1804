XXXI. To comprehend the whole world together in thy mind,
and <b>the</b> whole course of this present age to represent
it unto thyself, and to fix thy thoughts upon the sudden
change of every particular object. How short the time is
from the generation of anything, unto the dissolution of the
same; but how immense and infinite both that which was
before the generation, and that which after the generation
<b>of</b> it shall be. All things that thou seest, will soon
be perished, and they that see their corruptions, will soon
vanish away themselves. He that dieth a <b>hundred</b> years
old, and he that dieth young, shall come all to one.
