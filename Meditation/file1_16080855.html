II. Upon every action that thou art about, put <b>this</b>
question <b>to</b> thyself; How will this when it is done
agree with me? Shall I have no occasion to repent of it? Yet
a very little while and I am dead and gone; and all things
are at end. What then do I care for more than this,
<b>that</b> my present action whatsoever it be, may be the
proper action of one that is reasonable; whose end is, the
common good; who in all things is ruled and governed by the
same law of right and reason, by which God Himself is.
