XX. Let not that chief commanding part of thy soul be ever
subject to any variation through any corporal either pain or
pleasure, neither suffer it to be mixed with these, but let
it both <b>circumscribe</b> itself, and confine those
affections to their own proper parts and members. But if at
any time they do reflect and rebound upon the mind and
understanding (as in an united and compacted body it must
needs;) then must thou not go about to resist sense and
feeling, it being natural. However let not thy understanding
to this natural sense and feeling, which whether <b>unto</b>
our flesh pleasant or painful, is unto us nothing
<b>properly,</b> add an opinion of either good or bad and
all is well.
