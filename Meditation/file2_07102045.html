XXVII. Within a while the earth shall cover us all, and
<b>then</b> she herself shall have her change. And then the
course will be, from one period of eternity unto another,
and so a perpetual eternity. Now can any man that shall
consider with himself in his <b>mind</b> the several
rollings or successions of so many changes and alterations,
and the swiftness <b>of</b> all these rulings; can he
otherwise but contemn in his heart and despise all worldly
things? The cause of the universe is as it were a strong
torrent, it carrieth all away.
