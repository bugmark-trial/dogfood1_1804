XXV. The Pythagoreans were wont betimes in the morning the
first thing they did, to look up unto the heavens, to put
themselves <b>in</b> mind of them who constantly and
invariably did perform their task: as also to put
<b>themselves</b> in mind of orderliness, or good order, and
of purity, and of naked simplicity. For no star or planet
<b>hath</b> any cover before it.
