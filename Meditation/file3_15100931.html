XXXI. As long as the <b>foot</b> doth that which belongeth
unto it to do, and the hand that which belongs unto it,
their labour, whatsoever <b>it</b> be, is not unnatural. So
a man as long as he doth that which is proper unto a man,
his labour cannot be against nature; and if it be not
against nature, then neither is it hurtful unto him. But if
it were so that happiness <b>did</b> consist in pleasure:
how came notorious robbers, impure abominable livers,
parricides, and tyrants, in so large a measure to have their
part of pleasures?
