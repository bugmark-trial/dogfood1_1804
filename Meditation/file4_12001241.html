XLI. As the ordinary shows of the theatre and of other such
places, when thou art presented with them, affect thee; as
the same things still seen, and in the same fashion, make
the sight ingrateful and tedious; so must all the things
that we see all <b>our</b> life long affect us. For all
things, above and below, <b>are</b> still the same, and from
<b>the</b> same causes. When then will there be an end?
