XXII. Either this world is a kosmoz or comely piece, because
all disposed and governed by certain order: or if it be a
mixture, though confused, yet still it is a comely piece.
For is it possible that in thee there should be any beauty
at all, and that in the whole world there should be nothing
but disorder and confusion? and all things in it too, by
natural <b>different</b> properties one from another
differenced and <b>distinguished;</b> and yet all through
diffused, <b>and</b> by natural sympathy, one to another
united, as they are?
